Pandemy Simulator written in Python

Comes in two flavors:

1. A thrilling, action-packed real-time AAA simulator written in Pygame
2. A slow-paced, for-you-math-nerds text-only simulator with astonishing statistics and crazy numbers galore

Usage:

```bash
python3 pandemic.py
```
or
```bash
python3 bench.py
```

You can even fine-tune `constants.py` to suit your needs!
